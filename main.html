	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a concept used to describe how the runtime of an algerithm scale with the size of
	the input.It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to amount of memory space required by alogrithm as it processes the input data.Commonly, Space Complexity is expressed as 0(n), where n represents the size of the input.</p>
